*MACHINE LEARNING*

## Workflow
#### Feature Engineering
    Using the Diamonds data for the machine learning model to predict the price of the diamonds depending on their characteristics.

    First clean de Diamonds data set in  order to fix the missed values that could develop a problem in the model.

    Try to find and Clean outliers. 

    Change the categorical variables to numbers: 
        -1Âº using label encoder
        -2Âº using one hot enconding 
        -3Âº Do it manually depending on the diamonds characteristics. (This is the best one for the model selected)
    
    Take log in certain Variables in order to normalize these. 
#### Training
    Find the best model, checking the different possibilities (linear-regression, Random_forest, Catboosting)
### Best model ðŸ¤“
    CatBoosting(n_iterations=1000) using grid to select the best option in hyperparameters
    
### Analysis
    Drop city and index to reduce noise and useless variables.
    The label encoder is not the best, better to do it manually in order to put weight in the labels and improve the models. 

    The number of iterations is maybe determinant, its possible to add one million and boost the prediction.
